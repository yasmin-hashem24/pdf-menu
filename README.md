# Project proposal :
 
In today's digital age, online platforms have become an essential part of daily interactions for every community, class, and age group. As such, restaurants too need to have a clear online presence.

We are developing a system called "Diner Docs" that allows restaurant owners to upload their menus online in PDF format. Along with their menus, restaurant owners can provide basic information about their restaurants, such as the name, opening hours, and location.
 
# Problem formulation :
Maintaining an up-to-date menu is a clear issue for restaurant owners. When considering ways to make your menu available online, the most common options are through a Facebook post, an Instagram highlight, or by partnering with a menu-displaying and ordering application. However, this can be a rough process, as you are not in charge of keeping your menu up-to-date with new prices, products, or seasonal offers such as Ramadan or feast specials. This can lead to outdated information being shown to customers. Additionally, sharing profits with another platform can cut into your earnings with each order.

For customers, the process of having to sign in, create an account, or download an app just to view a menu can be tiring. Customers want an application that gathers restaurant menus in one place, providing convenience and saving time. They seek variety, enabling them to explore diverse cuisines and dining options. The application should assist in decision-making by offering comprehensive menu information for informed choices. With up-to-date information, customers can plan their dining experiences without any surprises.
# Offered solution:
As the owner or whoever is responsible for the menu design and display in your business, you always have an up-to-date and original version of your menu that you can easily edit. What we offer is the ability to upload and display your menu, while maintaining constant updates, without having your profit cut off by another business owner. Instead, you can have a simple subscription to our platform.

As a customer, you can access the menu by simply clicking a button. There is no need to create an account or go through a complicated process - it's a simple, published platform.
